# work_day_scheduler
Description

The project is all about the making the schedule of each day within working hours. When User loads the page then the current day and date of month is presented.
A list of time blocks is visible on the page which depicts the working hours from 9AM to 5PM. If current hour is 1 PM then it is colored as red. The time block
before current time is colored grey and timeblock for future of current hour is colored as green.

When user clicks on any timeblock a textarea is visible and user can enter the event for that time slot. Then user clicks on the save button and event is saved 
in the local storage. In this way user can save all the events in their relevent time blocks. If page is refereshed even then the events remain persistant.
